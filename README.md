Pandora's Lock

A lock for what could be a box of chaos.

This simple design uses very basic modules on perf board to control a relay that could drive a multitude of latches or contacts.

Currently it is used to secure:

    3D scanner

Using a Wemos D1 MINI R2, RM6800 RFID reader, a buck converter, and a Relay strip board we can connect to the portal and validate a user cert and unlock something.

The box uses a wall wart to get the relay coil voltage and power up the buck converter.

It also has two lit arcade buttons for status notification, and potential flagging of problems.
